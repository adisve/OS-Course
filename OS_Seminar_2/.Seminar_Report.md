## Task 1

We can see that the program has inconsistent state since several readers are reading while other writers are changing values, before all of the readers have had the chance to read. As well as different readers acquiring the wrong values after writers have changed the values in the program. This can occur when different processes/threads are not aware of each others execution and no monitoring is established between concurrent processes, in this case states would be useful.
